Create a kafka topic named `atscale`, 2 partitions and replication factor 1
To create a Kafka topic named "atscale" with 2 partitions and a replication factor of 1, you can use the following command in your Kafka broker's terminal:

css
Copy code
./kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic atscale
This assumes that you have already started your Kafka broker and have the kafka-topics.sh script in your PATH. The localhost:9092 argument is the address and port of your Kafka broker. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust this argument accordingly.

List all topics
To list all the topics in a Kafka cluster, you can use the following command in your Kafka broker's terminal:

css
Copy code
./kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This assumes that you have already started your Kafka broker and have the kafka-topics.sh script in your PATH. The localhost:9092 argument is the address and port of your Kafka broker. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust this argument accordingly.

This command will display a list of all the topics that have been created in your Kafka cluster.




Gökhan Tenekecioglu
Describe `atscale` topic
To describe a topic in Kafka, you can use the following command in your Kafka broker's terminal:

css
Copy code
./kafka-topics.sh --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic atscale
This assumes that you have already started your Kafka broker and have the kafka-topics.sh script in your PATH. The localhost:9092 argument is the address and port of your Kafka broker. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust this argument accordingly. The atscale argument is the name of the topic you want to describe.

This command will provide information about the topic, such as the number of partitions, the replication factor, and the leader for each partition. It will also show the current configuration settings for the topic.

we have data generator script called data-generator.sh. Use data-generator and send `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkansirin78/datasets/master/Churn_Modelling.csv` to  3 patitioned `churn` topic
Here's an example of how you can use a data generator script named data-generator.sh to send the contents of the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkansirin78/datasets/master/Churn_Modelling.csv file to a 3-partitioned Kafka topic named "churn".

First, download the data file and save it to a local file:
bash
Copy code
curl -o Churn_Modelling.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkansirin78/datasets/master/Churn_Modelling.csv
Then, run the following command to send the contents of the Churn_Modelling.csv file to the "churn" topic using the data-generator.sh script:
bash
Copy code
./data-generator.sh Churn_Modelling.csv churn 3
This assumes that you have already started your Kafka broker, have the data-generator.sh script, and that the script is set up to send data to the correct Kafka broker and topic. You may need to adjust the arguments to match your specific setup.




Gökhan Tenekecioglu
Message key should be CustomerId
If you want the message key to be the "CustomerId" field from the "Churn_Modelling.csv" file, you'll need to modify the data-generator.sh script to extract the "CustomerId" field and set it as the key for each message.

Here's a rough example of how you can modify the script to do this:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# set input file and topic name
input_file=$1
topic_name=$2
partitions=$3

# loop through each line of the input file
while IFS=',' read -r CustomerId Surname CreditScore Geography Gender Age Tenure Balance NumOfProducts HasCrCard IsActiveMember EstimatedSalary Exited; do
  # set the key as the CustomerId field
  key=$CustomerId

  # send the message to the Kafka topic
  echo "$key,$Surname,$CreditScore,$Geography,$Gender,$Age,$Tenure,$Balance,$NumOfProducts,$HasCrCard,$IsActiveMember,$EstimatedSalary,$Exited" | ./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic $topic_name --property "parse.key=true" --property "key.separator=,"
done < "$input_file"
This script sets the "CustomerId" field as the key for each message by setting the key variable to the value of the "CustomerId" field. The key is then passed to the kafka-console-producer.sh script as part of the message, along with the other fields from the "Churn_Modelling.csv" file. The --property "parse.key=true" and --property "key.separator=," options are used to indicate that the key is included in the message and separated from the value by a comma.

Note that this is just a rough example, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specifics of your data and the data generator script. You may need to adjust the script to match your specific setup.

Consume under `churn_group` and this group must have 3 consumer. 
    - Use different terminal for each consumer. 
    - Use `kafka-console-consumer.sh` as a consumer.
To start three consumers that belong to the same consumer group "churn_group" and consume from the "churn" topic, you can run the following command in three separate terminal windows:

vbnet
Copy code
./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic churn --group churn_group --consumer-property group.id=churn_group
This assumes that you have already started your Kafka broker and have the kafka-console-consumer.sh script in your PATH. The localhost:9092 argument is the address and port of your Kafka broker. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust this argument accordingly. The churn argument is the name of the topic you want to consume from, and the churn_group argument is the name of the consumer group.

With three consumers belonging to the same consumer group, Kafka will automatically balance the partitions among the consumers in the group. Each consumer will receive a unique set of messages, and if one of the consumers goes offline, the others will continue to consume messages and rebalance the partitions. This allows you to scale your consumption horizontally by adding more consumers to the group as needed.




Gökhan Tenekecioglu
Delete `atscale` and `churn` topics.
To delete the "atscale" and "churn" topics, you can use the kafka-topics.sh script with the --delete option. The exact command will depend on the specific setup of your Kafka cluster, but the general syntax is as follows:

javascript
Copy code
./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --delete --topic atscale
./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --delete --topic churn
This assumes that your Kafka broker is running on localhost and the ZooKeeper service is running on port 2181. If your broker and ZooKeeper are running on different hosts or ports, you will need to adjust the --zookeeper argument accordingly.

Note that once you have deleted a topic, it will no longer be available for producers to write to or for consumers to read from. You should be sure to backup any data you need before deleting a topic.




Gökhan Tenekecioglu
Delete `atscale` and `churn` topics without zookeeper.
To delete the "atscale" and "churn" topics without using ZooKeeper, you can use the kafka-topics.sh script with the --delete option and specify the address and port of your Kafka broker. The exact command will depend on the specific setup of your Kafka cluster, but the general syntax is as follows:

javascript
Copy code
./kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --topic atscale
./kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --topic churn
This assumes that your Kafka broker is running on localhost and the service is running on port 9092. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust the --bootstrap-server argument accordingly.

Note that once you have deleted a topic, it will no longer be available for producers to write to or for consumers to read from. You should be sure to backup any data you need before deleting a topic.

Using Python Kafka do the following tasksProduce the names of Turkey's geographical regions to a topic you specify, using the numbers you specify at the beginning of each of them as keys. For example, 1 Marmara
Here's an example of how you could use the Kafka-Python library to produce the names of Turkey's geographical regions to a specified topic, using numbers as keys:

python
Copy code
from kafka import KafkaProducer

# Set up the Kafka producer
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Define the topic you want to produce to
topic = "turkey_regions"

# Define the geographical regions and their corresponding keys
regions = [(1, "Marmara"), (2, "Aegean"), (3, "Mediterranean"), (4, "Black Sea")]

# Produce each region name to the specified topic, using the key as the partition
for key, region in regions:
    producer.send(topic, key=str(key).encode(), value=region.encode())

# Wait for all messages to be sent and acknowledged
producer.flush()
This code will send the names of the geographical regions to the topic named turkey_regions and will use the numbers specified at the beginning of each region as keys. The bootstrap-server argument should be set to the address and port of your Kafka broker. If your broker is running on a different host or port, you will need to adjust this argument accordingly. The key argument of the send method is used to specify the partition key, and the value argument is used to specify the actual value (i.e. the region name) to be sent.

With the Consumer, print the key, value, partition, timestamp information as following example.
Key: 1, Value: Marmara, Partition: 0, TS: 1613224639352 
Key: 4, Value: Black Sea, Partition: 1, TS: 1613224654849 
Key: 3, Value: Mediterranean, Partition: 2, TS: 1613224661486 
Key: 2, Value: Aegean, Partition: 2, TS: 1613224667044
Here's an example of how you could use the Kafka-Python library to consume the geographical regions from the turkey_regions topic and print the key, value, partition, and timestamp information:

python
Copy code
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

# Set up the Kafka consumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'turkey_regions',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    enable_auto_commit=True,
    group_id='turkey_group'
)

# Consume the messages from the topic
for message in consumer:
    key = message.key.decode()
    value = message.value.decode()
    partition = message.partition
    timestamp = message.timestamp
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}, Partition: {partition}, TS: {timestamp}")
This code sets up a consumer for the turkey_regions topic, connects to a Kafka broker running on localhost at port 9092, and consumes messages from the topic. The auto_offset_reset argument is set to earliest to start consuming from the earliest available message. The group_id argument is set to turkey_group to identify the consumer group. For each message, the key, value, partition, and timestamp information are extracted and printed to the console. The decode method is used to convert the key and value from binary data to string data.

Write a python function that fulfills the following requirements.
- Arguments: KafkaAdminClient object, topic name, number of partitions and replication factor
- Do not take any action if there is a topic with the same name
- If there is no topic with the same name, it will create a topic using arguments

def create_a_new_topic_if_not_exists(admin_client, topic_name="example-topic", num_partitions=1, replication_factor=1):
Here's a sample implementation:

python
Copy code
from kafka import KafkaAdminClient

def create_a_new_topic_if_not_exists(admin_client: KafkaAdminClient, topic_name: str = "example-topic", num_partitions: int = 1, replication_factor: int = 1):
    topic_list = admin_client.list_topics().topics
    if topic_name in topic_list:
        print(f"Topic '{topic_name}' already exists, not creating a new one.")
        return
    else:
        new_topic = NewTopic(topic_name, num_partitions=num_partitions, replication_factor=replication_factor)
        admin_client.create_topics(new_topic)
        print(f"Topic '{topic_name}' has been created with {num_partitions} partitions and replication factor {replication_factor}.")
This function first lists all the existing topics by calling list_topics() method of the KafkaAdminClient object, and stores the result in a topic_list variable. It then checks if the topic with the same name exists in the list by using in operator. If it exists, the function returns with a message that the topic already exists. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new topic using NewTopic class from the kafka package, and calls create_topics method of the KafkaAdminClient object with the new topic object as the argument. The function prints a message indicating that the topic has been created successfully with the specified number of partitions and replication factor.
